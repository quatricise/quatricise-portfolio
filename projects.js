    Flowerized is a 3D story adventure/farming game, where you play as Ilva - former astrobiologist who's lost her job and got demoted to an orbital cleaner position, where she picks up mangled bits of organisms that didn't manage to teleport properly. One day a similar thing happens to her, and she crashes onto an abandoned planet...

    Memory strata (plural of 'stratum') is a term I came up with to describe the layers of memories compressed together over long periods of time. What happens is that many of the things we remember become 'floating' - difficult to pinpoint when they actually happened, but still there, at the back of your mind, like ghosts.
